# Skill

A card that has more diverse effects to it, usually through providing block,
utilities, [[Buff|Buffs]], or [[Debuff|Debuffs]]. While it can be both offensive
and defensive, it is distinct from [[Attack]] cards in a way that **it cannot
deal direct damage**, capable of doing so only indirectly through Debuffs.
