# Process

A permanent upgrade for the entire combat encounter. While running, some
Processes give flat stats like [[Accuracy]] or [[Shield Efficiency]]. Some
Processes require certain conditions to be met that combat. Some Processes
provide a unique [[Buff]] that can potentially alter the play style. Each copy
of a given Process can only be played **once per combat**.
