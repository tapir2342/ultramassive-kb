# Status

*Statuses* are negative cards that are shuffled into your deck during combat.
*However, unlike [Curses](Virus.md), they will be removed at the end of combat.
*Under normal circumstances, most statuses are [[Unplayable]], and some impose
*an additional negative effect. They cannot be upgraded.
