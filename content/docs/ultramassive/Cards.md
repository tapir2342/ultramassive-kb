## Card Rarity

- **Starter** --- Cards that are in the deck the player begins the game with.
- **Common** --- Cards the player receives as rewards after combat or can purchase in a Shop.
- **Uncommon** --- Just like Common cards, however they appear less often as a reward and are more expensive.
- **Rare** --- Even rarer than Uncommon cards! Bosses always drop rare cards as reward. Rare cards cannot be purchased in a shop.

## Card Types

- **Attack** --- A card that deals direct damage to an enemy and may have a secondary
effect.
- **Skill** --- A card that has more diverse effects to it, usually through providing
shield, utilities, buffs, or debuffs. While it can be both offensive and
defensive, it is distinct from Attack card in a way that it cannot deal direct
damage, capable of doing so only indirectly through debuffs.
- **Power** --- A permanent upgrade for the entire combat encounter. Some Powers give
flat stats. Some powers require certain conditions to be met that combat. Some
powers provide a unique buff that can potentially alter the playstyle. Each copy
of a given power can only be played once per combat.
