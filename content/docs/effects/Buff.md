# Buff

A *Buff* is a positive effect given to the character by certain [[Cards]],
[[Potions]],Â or [[Relics]]. Buffs can also be applied to (Enemies)[List of
Enemies] through their moves or certain [[Relics]] or they can simply start
combat with the buff. All buffs are removed at the end of combat and do not
carry over to the next fight. Certain relics apply buffs at the start of combat.

Buffs may stack by duration, lasting X turns, or by intensity, applying their
effect with X power. Some buffs do not stack at all. However, most stack by
intensity.
